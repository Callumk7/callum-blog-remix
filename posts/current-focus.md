So I am getting close to finishing up my project [playQ](https://playQ.xyz), and I am going to have time to put towards some other projects. This post is an opportunity to put down my thoughts and see where I want to go next on my learning journey.

## Projects

The first, and most obvious choice would be to dedicate the time to starting a new project. I have some cool ideas cooking:

1. LLM powered world building assistant,
2. Project management / file management discord bot
3. Finish Recollect - a social journalling app

It is very likely that I will pick one of these up, and whilst doing so, make a deliberate effort to document my process for starting projects, and create a base-line or starting point with my preferred stack. 

## Learn a Language

I am a curious person, and I really want to build a proficiency with more languages than just js/ts.
