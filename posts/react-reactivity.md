Welcome to this comprehensive guide on React's reactivity model, an essential concept for every React developer out there. Let's delve into the heart of React and unravel some of its magic!

## The Reactivity Model

React is built on a powerful and intelligent reactivity model that powers the 'reactive' updates in our user interfaces. This model uses a virtual DOM - a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. When state changes occur, React creates a new virtual DOM and compares it to the old one, updating only the differing parts in the real DOM.

This model conserves computational resources and provides a smoother user experience. The crucial point is that this process is automatic - a key feature of React's reactivity model.

```jsx
function Component() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me!
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Hooks and Reactivity

React hooks are a way to use state and other lifecycle features in functional components. They interact with the reactivity model by allowing components to 'hook into' React's state management.

With hooks, we can trigger controlled re-renders, impacting the reactivity model directly. They're a powerful tool for developers who seek to optimize their application's performance.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

function Example() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/data')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setData)
  }, [])  // Note the empty dependencies array; useEffect will run once and not re-render.

  return (
    // UI Render logic here
  )
}
```

## Optimizing App Performance

Becoming accustomed to React's reactivity model and hooks can lead to more performance-driven coding practices. 

-  **Efficient state management**: Only trigger state changes when necessary to minimize re-renders.
-  **Optimized hook usage**: Maximize the efficiency of your hooks - for example, use the `useCallback` or `useMemo` hooks when calculative actions or functions don't need to be recalculated on each render.
-  **Lazy Load components**: Helps improve initial load time of your application.

## Conclusion

Understanding and leveraging React's reactivity model and hooks can provide massive benefits to your applications, breathing life into interactive UI and providing a smooth user experience. Keep enhancing your understanding and keep coding! See you later, goodbye.
