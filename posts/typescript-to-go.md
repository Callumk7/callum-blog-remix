TypeScript developers transitioning to Go often find themselves in unfamiliar territory, especially when dealing with type inference. Understanding how type inference works in both languages can help smooth the transition and bolster the efficiency of your Go code. This post will delve into Go’s type inference system, with a comparison to TypeScript and illustrative examples.

## 1. What is Type Inference?

Type inference refers to a language feature where the compiler can determine the data type of an expression during compilation. For example, in Go, you can define a variable like this:

```go
var i = 42
```

Here, `i` is inferred as an `int` based on its initial value, eliminating the need for explicit type declaration.

## 2. Comparing TypeScript and Go

TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, supports dynamic and flexible types. It uses type inference, and when a type cannot be inferred, TypeScript resorts to the `any` type, leading to flexibility and possible unpredictability.

On the other hand, Go, not being a superset of a dynamically typed language, applies a stricter type system. When type inference fails in Go, a compile-time error occurs.

## 3. Leveraging Type Inference in Go 

Here are some of the benefits of type inference in Go:

-  **Code Conciseness:** By using type inference, you create clean, concise code without explicit type declaration, focusing more on solving problems than declaring types.
-  **Ease of Refactoring:** If you change the type of a variable initialized with a value, type inference eliminates the need to update every instance of that variable in your codebase; simply update the initialization.
-  **Flexible Interfaces:** With type inference, Go can automatically infer the appropriate interface type based on the methods implemented by a struct, resulting in cleaner and more usable design.

## 4. Examples

Let's delve into more examples, translating TypeScript code into Go and considering type inference:

### Example 1: Variable Declaration & Initialization

In TypeScript:

```typescript
let num = 10;
let str = "Hello";
let flg = true;
```

In Go:

```go
num := 10
str := "Hello"
flg := true
```

### Example 2: Arrays / Slices 

In TypeScript:

```typescript
let arr = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
```

In Go:

```go
arr := []string{"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"}
```

### Example 3: Functions

In TypeScript:

```typescript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello ${name}`;
}

let result = greet("John");
```

In Go:

```go
func greet(name string) string {
    return "Hello " + name
}

result := greet("John")
```

In Go, functions' return types are always explicit, but you can employ type inference when receiving the returned values.

## Conclusion

Go has a unique approach to type inference that can lend your programming enhanced efficiency and readability. Understanding this approach and how it contrasts with TypeScript will help TypeScript developers transition seamlessly to Go programming. Just remember, practice is vital when acclimating to a new language - so why not start with type inference in Go?
