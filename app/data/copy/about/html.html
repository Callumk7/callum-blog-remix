  Hi, and thanks for stopping by. My name is Callum and I am a self taught web developer
  specialising in building full stack applications with
  <a href="https://remix-run.com">Remix</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.com">React</a> and
  <a href="https://typescript.com">Typescript</a>. Checkout my projects in the Project
  section, or leave a message!
</p>
<p>
  I've worked at start ups and scale ups as a Product manager, helping to deliver value
  through research, rapid testing and a desire to succeed.
</p>
<p>
  When I am not programming, I enjoy walking my dog, chess, photography and running. Reach
  out and lets connect!
