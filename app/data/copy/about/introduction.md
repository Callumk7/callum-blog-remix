Hi, and thanks for stopping by. My name is Callum and I am a self taught web developer specialising in building full stack applications with [Remix](https://remix-run.com), [React](https://reactjs.com) and [Typescript](https://typescript.com). Checkout my projects in the Project section, or leave a message!

I've worked at start ups and scale ups as a Product manager, helping to deliver value through research, rapid testing and a desire to succeed.

When I am not programming, I enjoy walking my dog, chess, photography and running. Reach out and lets connect!
